🏆 The Best: Docling (with the Heron Model)
Docling is currently the "gold standard" for offline layout analysis. It uses a vision-first model called Heron-101 that doesn't just "see" text; it understands how blocks relate to one another.

Why it’s the best for partitioning:
Reading Order Accuracy: Unlike traditional parsers that get confused by multi-column layouts (the "word salad" problem), Docling uses a 2D vision approach to map out the logical flow of the page.

Table & Figure Handling: It is exceptionally good at identifying table boundaries and keeping the cells together as a single "chunk," which is the hardest part of layout partitioning.

Built-in Chunking: It has a native "chunker" that can split documents based on the identified layout (e.g., "give me a chunk for every Level 2 heading and its contents").

True Offline Capability: It is designed for air-gapped environments. Once you've downloaded the initial model weights (about 200MB–500MB), it requires zero internet.
